# 3D-Axis-Calculator

This is a 3D Axis Calculator that has a variety of features for calculations in the 3D Axis.
The features this calculator has include:
  1) Finding the area of a parallelogram in the 3D axis
  2) Finding the area of a triangle in the 3D axis
  3) Finding the volume of a parallelepiped
  4) Finding the angle between two 3D vectors
  5) Finding the equation of a line in the 3D axis
  6) Finding the equation of a plane in the 3D axis
  7) Finding the angle between two planes in the 3D axis
  8) Finding the distance between a point to a plane in the 3D axis
  
Side Note: I used this in my H/ Pre-Calculus class for a chapter on "Analytic Geomtry in 3 Dimensions".
